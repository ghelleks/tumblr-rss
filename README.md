## Tumblr RSS ##

Subscribe to a much more pleasant feed for any Tumblr tumblelog.

Tumblr RSS feeds leave a great deal to be desired. So instead of subscribing
to one directly, subscribe through this script. It'll be great.

## Features ##

* If you have a multi-line caption, it'll only use the *first line* for the title! (Amazing!)
* If you have tags, it'll include the tags!
* If you use the Wordpress Markdown plugins, it'll add a "<!--nomarkdown-->" tag if you like!
* It caches results so you don't anger Tumblr!

## Install ##

1. Clone this repo or otherwise copy the files to a web server.
2. Change "atechnologyjobisnoexcuse" in feed.php to your tumblr blog's name,
unless you want to subscribe to Gunnar's blog.
3. Create a "cache" directory, and make sure your webserver can write to it.
4. Tell you syndication tool or RSS reader to fetch the feed.php file.
5. Enjoy!
